			<p>Do you like creating things? Working together to solve problems? Showing off your team's work? Then you'll love robotics! </p>

			<ul><b>This fall, there are three robotics teams to choose from:</b>
				<li>Lego (FLL) robotics for 6-8th graders. Meets every Wednesday this fall. Small robot. </li>
				<li>FTC robotics for 8th and 9th graders. Meets Tuesday and Thursdays this fall. Medium robot. </li>
				<li>FRC robotics for 10th-12th graders. Meets Tuesday in the fall, Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday in spring. Huge robots. </li>
			</ul>

			<p>This year, we're looking for people who get excited, want to learn, and are willing to work. The FLL and FTC teams are a great entry point - build a robot, program it to complete tasks, and make a presentation. FRC takes robotics to a whole new level - bigger robot, bigger challenge, bigger team, and bigger competition. This year, the FRC team is only taking a few people, especially those who want to program the robot, design t-shirts, sew strong bumpers, track sponsors, or organize things. </p>
